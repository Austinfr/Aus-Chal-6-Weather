## Goal

The goal of this challenge is to create a website which shows understanding of fetching data in javascript. How to use and implement the data given once recieved, which can be seen more in the code. If this website works as the description above provides then I have met the criteria.
The understanding should display both knowledge and use of [Open weather maps api](https://openweathermap.org/) 

This is what it should resemble:
